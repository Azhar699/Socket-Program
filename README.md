# 💬 Chat Server with Message Forwarding and Bad Word Detection

## 📘 Overview
This project implements a chat server where multiple clients can connect and send encrypted messages to each other. The server performs encryption and decryption on messages, ensures that bad words are filtered out, and supports forwarding messages between clients. It uses multithreading to handle multiple clients simultaneously and ensures synchronization with mutex locks.

## ✨ Features
- **Client-Server Communication**: Clients can send messages to each other via the server.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Messages are encrypted using a simple cipher based on a provided key and decrypted before displaying.
- **Bad Word Detection**: The server checks if messages contain any predefined bad words (e.g., "evil", "bad", "hate"). If detected, the message is ignored and a warning is sent back to the client.
- **Forwarding Messages**: Clients can forward messages to other clients by specifying the recipient's client number.
- **Multiple Client Support**: The server can handle multiple clients simultaneously, each in their own thread.
- **Dynamic Client List**: The server maintains a dynamic list of connected clients and updates all clients when someone connects or disconnects.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- C++11 or later
- Linux/Unix-like environment (using socket programming)
- Compiler supporting standard libraries (`iostream`, `string`, `vector`, `thread`, `map`, `mutex`, etc.)

## 📁 Files

- `server.cpp`: The main C++ file that implements the server-side logic, handling socket connections, message processing, encryption/decryption, and message forwarding.
- `client.cpp`: Implements the client-side logic. It connects to the server, sends encrypted messages, receives messages, and displays them to the user.
- `README.md`: This file containing the documentation for the project.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 🔽 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

### 🔧 Compile the Code

#### Server:
```bash
g++ server.cpp -o server -pthread
```

#### Client:
```bash
g++ client.cpp -o client -pthread
```

### 🚀 Run the Programs

#### Start the Server:
```bash
./server
```

#### Start a Client:
```bash
./client
```

## 🌐 Client Connection
Once the server is running, clients can connect by specifying the server IP and port (e.g., localhost:8080).

## 🧠 Key Functions

### ✅ containsBadWord
Checks if a message contains any predefined bad words.
```cpp
bool containsBadWord(const string &message);
```

### 🔐 encrypt
Encrypts a text message using a simple cipher with the provided key.
```cpp
string encrypt(string key, string text);
```

### 🔓 decrypt
Decrypts the message back to its original form using the same key.
```cpp
string decrypt(string key, string res);
```

### 📤 sendMessageToClient
Sends an encrypted message to a specific client using their socket.
```cpp
void sendMessageToClient(string encKey, string senderclientName, int recipientclientName,
                         const string &message, std::map<int, string> &cname, std::map<int, int> &cn);
```

### 🧩 handleClient
Handles incoming communication from a client. Decrypts, checks for bad words, and forwards valid messages.
```cpp
void handleClient(int clientNumber, int clientSocket, string clientName,
                  std::map<int, string> &cname, std::map<int, int> &cn);
```

### 🗣️ sendMessage
Allows the server to send a message to any connected client.
```cpp
void sendMessage(std::map<int, string> &cname, std::map<int, int> &cn);
```

## 🔄 Working of the Server

### 🛠️ Server Initialization
- Binds a socket to port 8080 and listens for incoming connections.

### 🤝 Client Connections
- Clients connect using the server’s IP and port.
- A new thread is created to handle each client individually.

### 📬 Message Handling
- Messages are encrypted before being sent and decrypted on the server.
- Messages containing bad words are ignored, and a warning is sent to the sender.
- Valid messages are forwarded to the recipient client.
- The server maintains a real-time list of connected clients.

### 🛑 Stopping the Server
- When the special keyword "123" is received from any client, the server shuts down and closes all connections.

## 💬 Example of Client Interaction

### Client 1 Sends:
```text
Hello Server!
```

### Server:
- If the message contains bad words → sends a warning.
- If clean → logs it and optionally forwards it.

### Client 2:
- If Client 1 addressed Client 2 using their client number, the message is forwarded after encryption.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements
- **Authentication**: Require clients to log in before accessing chat features.
- **GUI Interface**: Add a user-friendly GUI using Qt or SDL.
- **Improved Encryption**: Replace simple cipher with AES or other secure algorithms.
- **Message History**: Save and retrieve chat history using a database.
